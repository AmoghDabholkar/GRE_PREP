## These, in our opinion, are the most relevant books for GRE Prep that you can choose from.<br/>
### But based on its reputation and advice from our own seniors, we both chose to prefer Manhattan 5lb over the other books.<br/>
### About Manhattan 5lb -
- It is a very well structured book and is apt for almost all sub-types of questions asked in GRE.<br/>
- It is extremely good when it comes to the Quantitative and matches the level of actual GRE quite well. 
- In the verbal it is an excellent choice for practicing Reading Comprehensions and Logical Comprehensions because, the way in which the comprehensions, questions and the answer choices in the questions are structured mirror the original GRE.
- For Sentence Equivalence, it is an amazing start to help you build your thought process initially and understand the nuances like picking the correct pair of words and not the (seemingly) most correct single word answer. (Yes! This can be a bit tricky at times!)
- It is also a good choice to practice Text Completion questions.

### Apart from Manhattan 5lb, we also purchased a Magoosh GRE account and practiced mainly Verbal questions from there for a number of reasons.
- To add to the variety of questions we practiced.
